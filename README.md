# START-compiler

An open source compiler for the educational language START, originally developed by Leiden University and used by Leiden University in the Introduction to Programming course

Full credit for the Start programming language belongs to Joost Broekens, Jonne Goedhart, and any other Leiden University employees who contributed. 
I had no part in the creation of this language, this compiler is a hobby project to learn more about languages.
